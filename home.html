    <h1><center>What happens to my body during pregnancy?</center></h1> 
    <p style="margin-top:50px;"> Pregnancy is a period of considerable changes in a woman's body, and is different for every woman. These changes, affecting virtually every part of the body, are all geared towards growing and delivering a healthy baby, without harming the mother. Changes begin within days of conception when the fertilised egg implants itself in the wall of the uterus. The first changes are subtle, and most women will not notice them.Pregnancy lasts an average of 266 days, or 38 weeks, from the date of conception, or 40 weeks from the first day of the last menstrual period. Pregnancy is divided into three periods of three months each. These periods are known as the first, second and third trimesters. Each trimester brings with its own unique set of experiences.Pregnancy lasts about nine months of symptoms and what some consider pain, but at the end it’s all worth it for a lifetime of happiness. 
</p> 

<p> All these symptoms vary for each woman. You may or may not get some or all of these symptoms. Remember that a woman has the gift to bring life into this world, and that is a huge deal. Don’t underestimate your ability or strength. </p> 

    <h2>First Trimester:</h2> 
   <ul> 
      <li> Hormone levels increase. 
  <p> In the first trimester, you may experience breast tenderness and swelling as the first signs of your pregnancy. This is caused by increasing levels of the hormones estrogen and progesterone. These hormoneshelp maintain the pregnancy by improving vascularization (the formation of blood vessels), transfer nutrients, and support the developing baby. About ten days after conception, the placenta begins producing these hormones. The increase in the levels of these hormones commonly causes nausea and vomiting, widely known as morning sickness.</p></li> 

  <li> Body's nature kicks in. 
  <p> Early in pregnancy, many women also experience extreme tiredness, irritability, bloating, reflux, indigestion, dizziness and headache. You may also feel the need to urinate more often. The body’s nature may suddenly make you averse to smoking, drinking alcohol or eating particular foods to protect the developing fetus from harmful substances.These early symptoms, along with missed menstrual periods, will alert you that you may be pregnant. Good nutrition and avoiding harmful substances are especially important during this early phase of pregnancy.</p></li> 
    </ul> 

<h2>Second Trimester:</h2> 
<ul> 
<li> More hormonal changes.
<p>The second trimester is generally regarded as the best phase of a pregnancy. The morning sickness and tiredness have usually cleared up by week 12 and your growing belly is not yet too large to make you feel uncomfortable. However, you may find that hormonal changes make you more emotional and prone to slight periods of forgetfulness. On the bright side, most women find that the hormonal changes result in stronger nails, radiant skin and shiny hair from this phase of pregnancy onwards.</p></li> 
<li> Peeing more often. 
<p> You may suffer from water retention. By the start of the second trimester (at 12 weeks), the uterus extends beyond the pelvis into the abdomen and can usually be felt when the lower abdomen is examined. However, your pregnancy may not be obvious to casual observers for some weeks to come.</p></li> 

<li> You can feel your baby. 
<p> By about the 16th week, you may begin to feel the first flutters of movement from the baby. By about 20 weeks, your uterus will extend above the belly button, and an ultrasound scan can identify the gender of your baby. Between weeks 24 to 28, your baby is at his or her most active. More sensitive to the environment, your baby can respond to touch and will jump in reaction to a loud noise.</p></li> 
<li> Organs work harder. 
<p>The amount of blood pumped by your heart every minute increases by up to 50% during pregnancy. This increase peaks at around 24 weeks. Like the heart, the kidneys work harder throughout pregnancy, filtering an increasing volume of blood. The activity of the kidneys normally increases when a person lies down and decreases on standing up. This difference is amplified during pregnancy, which is one reason why you may feel the need to urinate frequently while trying to sleep.</p></li> 

<li> False alarm! 
<p>During the second trimester, you may also start experiencing occasional tightening of the uterus. These contractions, called Braxton Hicks contractions, are normal and harmless.</p></li> 
</ul> 

<h2>Third Trimester:</h2> 
<ul> 
<li> Weight gain. 
<p>During this time, the excitement of being pregnant is starting to wear off, the discomfort of a large belly is becoming annoying, and most mothers are eager to give birth and finally meet their babies.Your weight will continue to increase during the third trimester, sometimes to alarming levels. Weight gains of between 10 and 15 kg (20-30lb.) are quite normal during pregnancy, with low weight gain regarded as a warning sign of poor fetal growth.</p></li> 

<li> Heavy breathing and more peeing. 
<p>Your enlarging uterus extends to the level of the belly button by 20 weeks and to the lower edge of the rib cage by 36 weeks. The space taken up by the enlarging uterus and the increased production of the hormone progesterone cause your lungs to function differently. A pregnant woman breathes faster and more deeply because more oxygen is needed for herself and the fetus and you are likely to become increasingly out of breath after little effort. The lining of the respiratory tract also receives more blood during pregnancy, which can cause a stuffy nose and temporary changes in the sound of your voice. Hormonal changes may make you very emotional, irritable and prone to excessive sweating during this trimester. Late in pregnancy, the increase in kidney activity is even greater when a pregnant woman lies on her side rather than her back. Lying on your side relieves the pressure that the enlarged uterus puts on veins carrying blood from the legs and thus improves blood flow, increasing kidney activity and cardiac output.</p></li> 

<li> Your body will change on the outside. 
<p>Swelling (oedema) is common, especially in the legs. Varicose veins in the legs and the area around the vaginal opening (vulva) are also common in the third trimester. Ease the discomfort by wearing loose clothing around the waist and legs, wearing elastic support hose or resting frequently with your legs up. You may develop pigmentation changes in your skin during this phase of pregnancy. A common complaint is a mask of pregnancy (melasma), a blotchy, brownish pigment that may appear on the skin of the forehead and cheeks. Pigmentation may also increase in the skin surrounding the nipples, and a dark line commonly appears down the middle of the abdomen from the navel to the pubic bone. Small, spider-like blood vessels (spider angiomas) may appear in the skin, usually above the waist, as may thin-walled, dilated capillaries, especially in the lower legs.</p> 
<p>As your body prepares itself for birth, a hormone called relaxin begins to soften the hip joints. This may result in a change in your stride, and you may find yourself waddling. The weight of your uterus may also cause you to adopt a swaybacked posture late in pregnancy, which can cause backache.</p></li> 

<li> CRAVINGS! 
<p class="bottom">We all know one of the most common symptoms of pregnancy are cravings. Pica, a craving for strange foods or non-foods, such as starch or clay, may develop. As well as despising foods you used to love and loving foods you used to hate.</p></li> 
    </ul> 


<h1><center>What happens to my body after pregnancy?</center></h1> 
<p style="margin-top:50px;"> Many things are happening in your body right after you have a baby. During pregnancy, your body changed a lot. It worked hard to keep your baby safe and healthy. Now that your baby is here, your body is changing again. Some of these changes are physical, like your breasts getting full of milk. Others are emotional, like feeling extra stress.</p> 

<p>Many discomforts and body changes after giving birth are normal. Postpartum care is important because new moms are at risk of serious and sometimes life-threatening health complications in the days and weeks after giving birth.</p>

<li style="font-size: 27px;"> Perineum soreness. 
<p> The perineum is the area between your vagina and rectum. It stretches and may tear during labor and vaginal birth. It’s often sore after giving birth, and it may be more sore if you have an episiotomy. This is a cut made at the opening of the vagina to help let your baby out.</p> 

<h5> What can you do?</h5> 
<ul> 
<li class="item">Kegal exercises strengthen the muscles in the pelvic area. To do Kegel exercises, squeeze the muscles that you use to stop yourself from peeing. Hold the muscles tight for 10 seconds and then release. Try to do this at least 10 times in a row, three times a day.</li> 
<li class="item2">Put a cold pack on your perineum. Use ice wrapped in a towel. Or you can buy cold packs that you freeze in your freezer.</li> 
<li class="item2">Sit on a pillow or a donut-shaped cushion.</li> 
<li class="item2">Soak in a warm bath.</li> 
<li class="item-b">Wipe from front to back after going to the bathroom. This can help prevent infection as your episiotomy heals.</li> 
</ul>  

<li style="font-size: 27px;"> Afterbirth pains. 
<p> Afterbirth pains are belly cramps you feel as your uterus (womb) shrinks back to its regular size after pregnancy. The cramps should go away in a few days. Right after you give birth, your uterus is round and hard and weighs about 2½ pounds. By about 6 weeks after birth, it weighs only 2 ounces.</p> 
<h5> What can I do?</h5> 
<ul> 
<li class="item-b">Ask a responsable healthcare professional, such as your school nurse, about over-the-counter medicine you can take for pain. Over-the-counter medicine is medicine you can buy without a prescription from your provider.</li> 
</li> 
</ul> 

<li style="font-size: 27px;"> Vaginal discharge. 
<p> After your baby is born, your body gets rid of the blood and tissue that was inside your uterus. This is called vaginal discharge or lochia. For the first few days, it’s heavy, bright red and may contain blood clots. Over time, the flow gets less and lighter in color. You may have discharge for a few weeks or even for a month or more. </p> 

<h5> What can I do? </h5> 
<ul> 
<li class="item-b"> Use sanitary pads until the discharge stops.</li> 
</li></ul> 

<li style="font-size: 27px;"> Engorged breasts.  

<p> This is when your breasts swell as they fill with milk. It usually happens a few days after giving birth. Your breasts may feel tender and sore. The discomfort usually goes away once you start breastfeeding regularly. If you’re not breastfeeding, it may last until your breasts stop making milk, usually within a few days.</p> 

<h5> What can I do? </h5> 
<ul> 
<li class="item">Breastfeed your baby. Try not to miss a feeding or go a long time between feedings. Don’t skip night feedings.</li> 
<li class="item2"> Before you breastfeed your baby, squeeze a small amount of milk from your breast with a breast pump or by hand.</li> 
<li class="item2">Take a warm shower or lay warm towels on your breasts to help your milk flow. If your engorgement is really painful, put cold packs on your breasts.</li> 
<li class="item2"> If your breasts are leaking between feedings, wear nursing pads in your bra so your clothes don’t get wet.</li> 
<li class="item2">Tell a responsable healthcare professional, such as a school nurse, if your breasts stay swollen and are painful.</li> 
<li class="item-b">If you’re not planning to breastfeed, wear a firm, supportive bra (like a sports bra).</li> 
</ul> 

<li style="font-size: 27px;"> Nipple pain. 
<p>If you’re breastfeeding, you may have nipple pain during the first few days, especially if your nipples crack.</p> 

<h5> What can I do? </h5> 
<ul> 
<li class="item">Talk to your provider or a lactation consultant to be sure your baby is latching on to your breast the right way. Latching on is when your baby’s mouth is securely attached to 
  (placed around) your nipple.</li> 
<li class="item2"> Ask your provider about cream to put on your nipples.</li> 
<li class="item-b">After breastfeeding, massage some breast milk onto your nipples. Let your breasts air dry.</li> 
</li></ul>  

<li style="font-size: 27px;"> Swelling. 
<p>Lots of women have swelling in their hands, feet and face during pregnancy. It’s caused by extra fluids in your body. It may take time for the swelling to go away after you have your baby.</p> 

<h5> What can I do? </h5> 
<ul> 
<li class="item">Lie on your left side when resting or sleeping.</li> 
<li class="item2">Put your feet up.</li> 
<li class="item2">Try to stay cool and wear loose clothes.</li> 
<li class="item-b">Drink plenty of water.</li> 
</li></ul> 

<li style="font-size: 27px;"> Hemorrhoids. 
<p>Hemorrhoids are painful, swollen veins in and around the anus that may hurt or bleed. Hemorrhoids are common during and after pregnancy.</p> 

<h5> What can I do? </h5> 
<ul> 
<li class="item">Soak in a warm bath.</li> 
<li class="item2"> Ask your provider about using an over-the-counter spray or cream for pain.</li> 
<li class="item2">Eat foods that are high in fiber, such as fruits, vegetables and whole-grain breads and cereals.</li> 
<li class="item2">Drink lots of water.</li> 
<li class="item-b">Try not to strain when you’re having a bowel movement (pooping).</li> 
</li></ul>  

<li style="font-size: 27px;"> Constipation. 
<p>Constipation is when you don’t have bowel movements, you don’t have them often or your stools (poop) are hard to pass. You also may have painful gas. This may happen for a few days after you give birth. </p> 

<h5> What can I do? </h5> 
<ul> 
<li class="item">Eat foods that are high in fiber. Such as: oranges, berries, broccoli, and/or nuts. To have a full list of food rich on fiber, click <a href="https://www.nutrition.org.uk/healthyliving/basics/fibre.html">here</a>.</li> 
<li class="item2">Drink lots of water</li> 
<li class="item-b">Ask your provider about medicine to take.</li> 
</li></ul> 

<li style="font-size: 27px;"> Urinary trouble. 
<p>In the first few days after giving birth, you may feel pain or burning when you pee. Or you may try to urinate but find that you can’t. Sometimes you may not be able to stop urinating. This is called incontinence. It usually goes away as your pelvic muscles become stronger again.</p> 

<h5> What can I do? </h5> 
<ul> 
<li class="item">Drink a lot of water.</li> 
<li class="item2">Run water in the sink when you go to the bathroom.</li> 
<li class="item2">Soak in a warm bath.</li> 
<li class="item-b">Do Kegal excercises to strengthen your pelvic muscles.</li> 
</li></ul>  

<p class="bottom"> If the pain continues, contact a professional healthcare adult.</p></li>
