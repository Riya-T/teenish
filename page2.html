<h1><center>What do I need to have a healthy pregnancy?</center></h1> 

  <h3 class="t-subhead">Proper prenatal care. </h3> 

  <p class="pb">Prenatal care is the healthcare you receive while pregnant. Regular prenatal care throughout your pregnancy helps to catch potential concerns early and reduces the risk of pregnancy and birth complications.</p> 

   

  <ul> 

    <li><b>Seek prenatal care.</b>
      <p> During pregnancy, regular prenatal visits can help your health care provider monitor your health and the baby's health. Teens might need specialized prenatal care.</p></li> 

    <li><b>Eat a healthy diet.</b> 
      <p>During pregnancy, a teen will need more folic acid, calcium, iron and other essential nutrients. A daily prenatal vitamin can help fill any gaps. You can find these vitamins 
      in practically any pharmacy. Make sure to discuss with a health care professional about the best vitamins for you and your baby before buying any.</p></li> 

    <li><b>Stay physically active.</b><p>Regular physical activity can help ease discomfort and boost your energy level. Encourage yourself to get a health care provider's OK before starting or
       continuing an exercise program, especially if you have an underlying medical condition.</p></li> 

    <li>Gain weight wisely.  

    <p>Gaining the right amount of weight can support the baby's health — and make it easier for you to lose weight after delivery.</p></li> 

    <li>Avoid risky substances.  

    <p>Alcohol, tobacco and any illegal drugs are off-limits during pregnancy. Even use of supplements and prescription and over-the-counter medications deserve caution.</p></li> 

    <li>Take childbirth classes.  

    <p class="pb">These classes can help prepare yourself for pregnancy, childbirth, breast-feeding and being a parent. Of course, you may not always be able to afford these classes, 
      which is why there are websites where you can find resources exactly for this, like <a href="https://get.pampers.com/en-us/childbirth-education-series">Pampers Website</a> and 
      youtube channels like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/BridgetTeyler/videos">Bridget Teyler</a>'s, a childbirth educator and doula whose youtube channel is packed with helpful advice and tips! </p></li> 

  </ul> 

   

  <h3>Healthy dieting!</h3> 

  <p>Pregnancy is a great time to try and look after yourself and get lots of nutrients for you and your baby, giving him/her the best start in life. 
    Try to eat lots of different foods every day and include something from each of the following main food groups;</p> 

   

  <h4 class="subhead">Foods.</h4> 

  <ul> 

    <li>Bread, rice, potatoes or pasta (wholegrain if possible) 

    <p>Try to base your meals on these; they give you the energy you and your baby need.</p></li> 

    <li>Fruit and vegetables (fresh, frozen, dried or canned) 

    <p>Try to eat 5 different fruits and vegetables a day, a small glass of fruit juice can count as one. They contain lots of vitamins and minerals for your baby’s growth and development.</p></li> 

    <li>Meat, fish, eggs and beans 

    <p>Try to eat a couple of these a day; they are important for your baby’s growth. Canned fish is cheap and nutritious and so are canned peas, beans and lentils like baked beans, chick peas and red kidney beans.</p></li> 

    <li>Milk and dairy foods (cheese, yogurt) or dairy-free alternatives if you are vegan 

    <p class="pb">Try to eat a couple of these a day; they are important for your baby’s bones.</p></li> 

  </ul> 

   

  <h4 class="subhead">Drinks.</h4> 

  <ul> 

    <li>Water 

    <p> Water is the healthiest and cheapest!</p></li> 

    <li>Unsweetened fruit juice 

    <p>It can be a good source of vitamin C, but high in sugar, so stick to one small glass a day with your breakfast, lunch or dinner.</p></li> 

    <li>Semi-skimmed milk 

    <p>It can be enjoyed with a snack or on its own. It’s high in calcium so it‘s good for you and your baby's bones.</p></li> 

  </ul> 

  <p class="pb"> Try not to drink too many sugary drinks, like sugary fizzy drinks, and don’t forget – energy drinks, tea and coffee contain caffeine which you shouldn’t have too much of when you are pregnant.
