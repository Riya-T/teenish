<h1><center>Do I run any risks? How do I combat them?</center></h1>
<p> As a teen, pregnancy appears to put you at increased risk of high blood pressure, anemia, premature birth, having low birth weight babies and experiencing postpartum 
  depression.</p> 
<p>Pregnant teens are at risk of not getting the right prenatal care, especially if you don't have support from your parents. Prenatal care is critical, especially in the first months 
of pregnancy. Prenatal care looks for medical problems in both mother and baby, monitors the baby's growth, and deals quickly with any complications that arise.</p>
  
<ul>
    <li>High blood pressure
      <p>Pregnant teens have a higher risk of getting high blood pressure, called pregnancy-induced hypertension, than pregnant women in their 20s or 30s. 
        They also have a higher risk of preeclampsia. This is a dangerous medical condition that combines high blood pressure with excess protein in the urine, swelling
        of a mother's hands and face, and organ damage.</p>

        <p>These medical risks affect the pregnant teen, who may need to take medications to control symptoms.</p></li>

    <h5>What can I do to cope with this?</h5>
    <ul>
      <li class="item-b" class="item">Some medications can disrupt the unborn baby's growth. And they can lead to further pregnancy complications such as premature birth.
        But there are some that are safer than others like methyldopa and labetalol. These drugs that are considered safe to use to manage blood pressure 
        during pregnancy.</li> 
    </ul>

      <li>Premature birth
        <p>A full-term pregnancy lasts about 40 weeks. A baby that delivers before 37 weeks is a premature baby, or "preemie." 
          The earlier a baby is born, the more risk there is of respiratory, digestive, vision, cognitive, and other problems.</p></li>
      <h5>What can I do to cope with this?</h5>
      <ul>
        <li class="item-b" class="item"> In some cases, premature labor that begins too early in pregnancy can be stopped by medications. Other times, the baby 
          has to be delivered early for the health of the mother or infant. Speak with a health care professional about this issue and ask what 
          they recommend for your case.</li>
        </ul>

        <li>Pospartum depression
          <p>Pregnant teens may be at higher risk of postpartum depression (depression that starts after delivering a baby.
            Girls who feel down and sad, either while pregnant or after the birth, should talk openly with their doctors or someone else they trust. 
            Depression can interfere with taking good care of a newborn, and with healthy teenage development, but it can be treated.</p></li>

          <h5>What can I do to cope with this?</h5>
          <ul>
            <li class="item">Create a secure attachment with your baby
              <p>A secure attachment is formed when you as the mother respond warmly and consistently to your baby’s physical and emotional needs. 
                When your baby cries, you quickly soothe him or her. If your baby laughs or smiles, you respond in kind. In essence, you and your child 
                are in sync. You recognize and respond to each other’s emotional signals.</p>
              <p>Check out <a href="https://www.helpguide.org/articles/parenting-family/creating-secure-infant-attachment-video.htm">this video</a> to 
              learn how.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="item2">Seek help, support, and guidence from others
              <p> Positive social contact relieves stress faster and more efficiently than any other means of stress reduction. Historically and from an evolutionary perspective, 
                new mothers received help from those around them when caring for themselves and their infants after childbirth. In today’s world, new mothers often find themselves alone, 
                exhausted and lonely for supportive adult contact. 
                <ul>
                  <li class="item"><b>Make your relationships a priority.</b> When you’re feeling depressed and vulnerable, it’s more important than ever to stay connected 
                to family and friends, even if you’d rather be alone.</li>
                  <li class="item2"><b>Don’t keep your feelings to yourself.</b> In addition to the practical help your friends and family 
                can provide, they can also serve as a much-needed emotional outlet. Share what you’re experiencing --the good, the bad, and the ugly-- with at least one 
                other person.</li>
                  <li class="item-b"><b>Be a joiner.</b> Even if you have supportive friends, you may want to consider seeking out other women who are dealing with the same transition 
                into motherhood. It’s very reassuring to hear that other mothers share your worries, insecurities, and feelings.</li>
              </p></ul></li>

            <li class="item-b"> Take care of yourself
              <p>One of the best things you can do to relieve or avoid postpartum depression is to take care of yourself. The more you care for your mental and physical 
                well-being, the better you’ll feel. Simple lifestyle changes can go a long way towards helping you feel like yourself again. 
                <ul>
                  <li class="item"><b>Skip the housework.</b> Make yourself and your baby the priority.</li> 
                  <li class="item2"><b>Ease back into exercise.</b> Studies show that exercise may be just as effective as medication when it comes 
                to treating depression, so the sooner you get back up and moving, the better.</li> 
                  <li class="item2"><b>Practice mindfulness meditation.</b> Research supports the effectiveness of meditation for making you feel calmer and more energized.</li>
                  <li class="item2"><b>Don’t skimp on sleep.</b> A full eight hours may seem like an unattainable luxury when you’re dealing with a newborn, but poor sleep 
                  makes depression worse. Set aside quality time for yourself to relax and take a break from your mom duties.</li>
                  <li class="item2"><b>Make meals a priority.</b> When you’re depressed, nutrition often suffers. What you eat has an impact on mood, as well as the quality of your 
                  breast milk, so do your best to establish healthy eating habits.</li> 
                  <li class="item-b"><b>Get out in the sunshine.</b> Sunlight lifts your mood, so try to get at least 10 to 15 minutes of sun per day.</li>
                </ul></p>
            </li>
