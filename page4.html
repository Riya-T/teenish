<h1><center>What are my options?</center></h1>

<p>Once you are pregnant, you can decide what will be the next steps. If you decide to have and raise the baby, you may need help identifying a strong 
  support system. Teens and young girls who have babies can certainly achieve their personal life goals and raise healthy successful children, but often it will 
  be considerably more challenging.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Kinship care
    <p>In kinship care arrangements, which have become increasingly common in recent years, a grandparent or other relative serves as a parent to the infant. 
      This may be through an informal, private arrangement or through child welfare systems, which vary by state.</p>

      <p>Kinship care arrangements can give a teen an opportunity to be involved with raising his or her child, as well as the chance to take on responsibilities 
      of parenthood in the future. Growing evidence also suggests that babies in kinship care arrangements fare better than those cared for by unrelated foster
      parents. However, kinship care arrangements face unique challenges.</p>

      <h5>If you're considering kinship care, here are a few things you should consider:
        <ul>
          <li class="item">Most children living with relatives are in informal arrangements, and this creates a problem if the relatives do not have the authority to give legal 
            consent for needed medical care, including immunizations and other non-emergency health services. Your pediatrician can help connect you with community 
            legal resources to help you take steps to gain legal authority to help children get the medical care they need to stay healthy.</li>
          <li class="item2">Older family caregivers who haven't parented an infant for several years may not be aware of changes to safety standards for sleep, car seats and 
            injury prevention.</li>
          <li class="item-b">Raising an infant the second time around can be a deeply rewarding and invigorating experience. However, it's a good idea for older caregivers to 
            have a plan in place for guardianship in the event they experience health declines.</li>
        </ul>
      </h5>
  </li>

  <li>Adoption
    <p>Adoption is another option for teens who want to have their baby but don't feel ready or able to become a parent. Over 2 million couples are currently 
      waiting to adopt, love, and care for a baby in the U.S.—which translates into three dozen couples in line for every child placed for adoption.</p>
    
    <p>The decision to place a baby with an adoptive family is legal and binding. However, most states do allow the birth mother anywhere from several days to 
      several months after the child is born to change her mind. Information about adoption laws can be found on the <a href="https://www.childwelfare.gov/nfcad/"
      >Child Welfare Information Gateway</a>, which is a service of the Children's Bureau in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. </p>
      <h5>If you're considering adoption, here are a few things you should know:
        <ul>
          <li class="item">In public adoptions, the child is placed in a family by an agency operated or contracted by the state.</li>
          <li class="item2">In private or independent adoptions, the birth parents may work with an attorney, physician, clergy member, or a licensed or unlicensed facilitator.</li>
          <li class="item2">In closed adoptions, the names of the birth mother and the adoptive parents are kept secret from each other.</li>
          <li class="item-b">In open adoptions, the birth parent may choose to personally select the adoptive parents, meet with them, and even maintain an ongoing relationship. 
            Open adoptions, research shows, may lessen feelings such as grief or guilt some birth parents who make an adoption plan for their child may experience.</li>
        </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Parenting
    <p>Whether someone is parenting by themselves, with a partner or support from their family, it’s important to think about how they can provide a positive environment for 
      the baby as it grows. Babies need safety, food, clothing, diapers, toys, day-care etc.  Social assistance is available to help with the cost of these things, but it may 
      mean living on a tight budget.  The biggest and most important thing a baby needs to be happy and healthy is love. This is something we can all provide no matter our age.</p>
      <h5>If you're considering parenting, here are a few things you should know:
        <ul>
          <li class="item">When someone is under 18 years of age and choosing to parent, Child and Family Services (CFS) is required to check-in on the family. They have workers whose 
            job is to help young parents become more comfortable and adjust to their new role. It is better to contact CFS yourself if you’ve decided to parent because they can help with 
            accessing pre and post natal supports and programs.</li>
          <li class="item-b">It’s important for parents to think about how they can take care of them self. It can be stressful raising a baby. Making time for yourself to do 
            something you enjoy is still important because stress levels can affect both a parent’s and baby’s health and wellbeing. Finding people that you trust and can talk with 
            can also make a big difference. This could be a friend, a family member, a counsellor or a parenting group.  Parenting programs, supports and resources including parenting 
            friendly schools are available.</li></ul>

  <li>Ending the pregnancy
      <p>Because some pregnant teens will consider abortion, we encourage you to talk to a parent or trusted adult before 
        making such a big decision.</p>

      <p>Teens who are willing to involve their parents in their abortion decision, as most are, usually benefit from adult experience, wisdom, emotional and 
        financial support. Parental notification laws exist and vary from state to state.</p>
          <h5>If you're considering ending the pregnancy, here are a few things you should know:
            <ul>
              <li class="item">Talk to your pediatrician about local laws affecting the pregnancy termination options and where to find trained and licensed providers. 
                Medical and surgical abortions are safe when performed by licensed and experienced physicians.
              </li>
              <li class="item2">Out-of-pocket costs for abortion services can be a barrier for pregnant teens and their families.  Lack of money can cause delays, 
                which can lead to more complicated procedures further along in the pregnancy. Sources of financial assistance may be available in your community 
                or state.</li>
              <li class="item2">Most women will not experience any problems, but there is a small risk of complications, such as:

                infection of the womb (uterus),
                some of the pregnancy remaining in the womb,
                excessive bleeding,
                damage to the womb or entrance of the womb (cervix).</li>
              <li class="item-b">Abortion is a safe procedure. Abortions are safest, and happen with less pain and bleeding, when carried out as early as 
                possible in pregnancy.</li>
              </li></ul>
