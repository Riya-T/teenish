<h1><center>Testimonials</center></h1> 

<p><center>Many women have gone through teen pregnancy, and many of them have shared their experiences.</center></p> 

<h3 class="t">Sarah's Story</h3>
<p class="t">"When I was 16 I found out I was pregnant, feelings scattered everywhere, panic racing through my mind, what the hell was 
  I going to do with a baby? How was I going to feed, dress, provide, and take care of a new born child when I wasn’t even legal 
  to vote, let alone give birth? Although my friends were all out drinking, off with boys which usually ended up in sexual intercourse. 
  They were not the ones who got caught and had to figure out how to deal with the consequences.</p>

<p class="t">Every person’s story is different, some people struggle and some not as much. If anyone tells you it is easy being a 
  mother or father they are 100% lying, if it’s easy you’re not doing it properly! Challenges face you every step of the way but 
  you don’t just cry about them you figure out how to deal with them, and just cope with whatever faces you each step of the way.</p>

<p class="t">I gained one very amazing thing from having my daughter which was she reminded me I had a very important reason to do 
  well in life. That was to give her everything she needed. Having her helped me to cop on, get a job and finish school. Before I 
  had her I wanted to drop out of school and go to FĀS to get paid. However I continued on to do a Journalist course in college, 
  and I am now graduating from college as a qualified Journalist and have never felt better, even if I was a teen mum.</p>

<p class="t">Your priorities change for the better most times, I would not change the way my life went. Having a child so young was 
  difficult because you have a lot of stereotypes who judge you no matter what.  So why not just make the right decision by you and
  your child. Try by all means to avoid falling pregnant so young obviously, but if it happens remember there is always help out 
  there, and it is not the end of the world."</p>

<h3 class="t">Leanne's Story</h3>
<p class="t">"I was only 17, two weeks along, when I found out I was 5 weeks pregnant. I went to the doctor's to get Nexplanon 
  -- birth control implant -- and the doctor said I was a week late and she did a test. I wasn’t worried at all; I just thought I was 
  late over exam stress. I’ll never forget hearing "Leanne you’re pregnant". I could hear it like an echo, going numb and starting to 
  cry, shake and panic. I’d only had a boyfriend for six months. We were just stupid and didn’t use contraception. I never had proper 
  information about contraception and no talks at home. I never felt so scared in all my life. I thought it was a dream and just had 
  a pain in the pit of my stomach for about a week.</p>

<p class="t">Telling my parents wasn’t too bad because they thought I was joking. When they realised I wasn’t, I was made feel 
  bad about it and told I’d have to leave school and work to support us. Other than thinking "what if I die?", my main worries were 
  how would I live? What would I survive on? What if I get kicked out?</p>

<p class="t">I wanted to keep my baby, I knew I didn’t want an abortion no matter what I had to face. Thankfully my school got me 
  involved with the <a href="https://www.tpsp.ie/about.PAGE3.html">Teen Parent Support Programme</a> in Doras Buί who gave me all 
  the information I needed and just made me feel at ease 
  about everything. I always wanted to be a young mom but definitely not that young. I don’t think I would have got pregnant if there 
  was more information out there. I had a rough pregnancy with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/preeclampsia/
  symptoms-causes/syc-20355745#:~:text=Preeclampsia%20is%20a%20pregnancy%20complication,blood%20pressure%20had%20been%20normal.">
  pre-eclampsia</a> and an emergency section 5 weeks early. But when my tiny 3 pound 8 ounce baby finally arrived when I was 17, I 
  fell so in love with him. I’d face the world to have a life with him and provide for him. I went back to school after 4 weeks, 
  completed my leaving cert and a course and now am a working mom to a healthy six year 
  old. Thinking back to the sleepless nights up until he was 2, his colic and reflux, and then up early for school, makes me wonder 
  how I ever did it."</p>

<p class="t">I am proud of myself. Being a young parent on your own with little help is tough especially with my boy going through 
  tests for ADHD, he can be a handful. Dealing with a dad you don’t get along with makes the situation a million times more 
  difficult. Looking back it is a scary struggle and I’m in no rush for more kids but I wouldn’t change having him for the world 
  and he’s the best little thing in my life.</p>

<h3 class="t">Charlotte's Story</h3>
<p class="t">I don’t really know why I did it. I know if I could take it back, I would have waited longer. I was 15 the first 
  time I had sex. I was 17 when I got pregnant.</p>

  <p class="t">I found out when my period was late and I was getting questions from my mum and stuff. So I took and test and found out then. 
  I was shocked because there were exams coming up and everything else, so I just thought I was stressed. I never thought I was 
  pregnant, didn’t think it for one minute. I kept saying to myself, "no I can’t be pregnant, I just can’t". So I kept trying to 
  put it to the back of my mind. When I’d had exams before I didn’t have my period for months just because of the pressure and 
  wanting to do well in them, so I when I missed my period this time, I just thought it was the same thing again – it was that 
  time of year – Christmas exams.</p>
  
  <p class="t">So I went and told mum and dad. They were supportive but angry and upset at the same time. Dad left the room. Mum was 
  like “It’s going to be ok, but what the hell?”</p>
  
  <p class="t">Then we had to go and tell his mum. He wasn’t able to say the words. I had to do it. Her reaction was basically “you have ruined 
  this girl’s life”.</p>
  
  <p class="t">There are days it’s difficult and days it’s ok. My little boy could just have a tantrum and he could carry that on all day. 
  He could mess up everything you’ve tidied. Then there’s other days where he’ll be smiling and laughing and it brings you joy. 
  There are days that are hard and days that are good, but you just have to take it all as it comes.</p>
  
  <p class="t">Don’t think having a child is going to be easy. For the first few months you’ll be up at 4 or 5 o’clock in the morning, 
  feeding him and changing him and all the rest. It is hard."</p>
